Language
========

Hereafter, OpenQASM refers to the extended language we now describe. The
human-readable form of OpenQASM is a simple C-like textual language.
Statements are separated by semicolons. Whitespace is ignored. The
language is case sensitive. Appendix `[app:summary] <#app:summary>`__
summarizes the language statements,
Appendix `[app:grammar] <#app:grammar>`__ specifies the grammar, and
Appendix `[app:semantics] <#app:semantics>`__ gives formal semantics.
